One of biggest project for now. Its page with few simple games. All wrote in JS

Its a web with games like blackjack, saper, memory or hangman.

Mainly i was trying to recreate games made in courses.

I was using mainly java script and sass.

Page is not finished and probably wont be in the nearest future ... no free time :) have to learn harder things
